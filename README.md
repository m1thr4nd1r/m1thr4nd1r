# Hey there, I'm Victor

## About me

I'm a curious programmer, which led me to dabble in several technologies, but mostly I consider myself a backend developer with experience in:

- C# :white_check_mark: :white_check_mark: :white_check_mark: :black_square_button: :black_square_button:
- Java :white_check_mark: :white_check_mark: :black_square_button: :black_square_button: :black_square_button:
- Python :white_check_mark: :white_check_mark: :black_square_button: :black_square_button: :black_square_button:
- PHP :white_check_mark: :black_square_button: :black_square_button: :black_square_button: :black_square_button:

Currently, I'm studying/experimenting with game development, initially on Unity, since my Master's degree has concluded. My portfolio, including [this](https://www.audiogamebreu.com.br/) Portuguese audio game, is currently in development. 

Finally, I like to pass on the knowledge I have gained while also helping people enter the tech industry, especially if they are from a minority.
